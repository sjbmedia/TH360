#SCRIPT SUMMARY

##utils

	ColorTheSelectable.cs

 * operates shader parameters.
 * change shader parameter by <code>SetFloat/SetTexture/etc</code> is not a good design.consider do it like this.
 * it co-works with <code>MulLayerColor.shader</code>.but any shader support the parameters will be ok.
 
	CustomButton.cs

 * 3d button implement.
 * process the button visible effects.

	JfDrawLine.cs

 * Draw line on screen.
